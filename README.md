# Binary_Search_Tree_Python
This document details the design and implementation of a Python-based Binary Search Tree (BST) program. The program adheres to the fundamental properties of a BST, ensuring that each node satisfies both the node property (left subtree < node value < right subtree) and the recursive structure inherent to BSTs.

The functionality encompasses BST construction, data insertion, and search operations. The program provides a user-friendly interface, prompting the user to input numbers or enter "done" to signal completion of input. Upon termination, the program efficiently determines and displays the minimum and maximum values entered by the user. The interactive nature of this program enhances user engagement and facilitates easy data manipulation within the BST structure. The utilization of Python contributes to the program's readability, maintainability, and overall efficiency.
